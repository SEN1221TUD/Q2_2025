This folder contains resources to help you prepare for the practical exam. <br>

### Documentation-hub
The practical exam aims to assess your hands-on Machine Learning skills, not your Python syntax knowledge perse. Therefore, we created a Documentation-hub. The documentation hub is a collection of useful resources that you can use during the practical exam. It contains:
- All **Lab session notebooks with solutions** (in html format)
- Documentation of the **most important libraries** used during the course: pandas and biogeme.<br>

To familiarise yourself with the **documentation hub**, you can already download it and have a look:
* Click on this [link](https://github.com/SEN1221TUD/Documentation-hub/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the zip file directly, or browse to the documentation [repository](https://github.com/SEN1221TUD/Documentation-hub).
* Unzip the repo file
* Open the folder and **double-click** on the file named index.html
* The landing page will open in your browser (Chrome)

### Checklist and toy datasets
In addition, we provide a [checklist](preparation_checklist.md) of things you should be familiar with before the exam as well as some toy datasets that allow you to practice.
