    "<br>\n",
    "### ANS\n",
    "ANS is used to collect your answers. You do **not** need to **submit** your notebook file<br>\n",
    "- Start ANS from the icon located on the desktop\n",
    "- Log in with your school account and select Technische Universiteit Delft\n",
    "- Login with your own NetID and password\n",
    "- Exactly on time the exam becomes active under Live Assignments (refresh the page if needed using F5)\n",
    "- Start the exam by clicking on it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "The exam consists of eight **multiple-choice** questions and four **numerical** questions, with numerical questions being worth approx. double the points of multiple-choice questions."

    "A electronics company considers to enter the smartphone market. To better understand the importance of attributes, such as Cost, Size, Memory storage, Camera quality and Operating System (OS) it has hired a high-end consultant to figure out how important these attributes are to consumers of different age groups and genders.  Therefore, the consultant has conducted a Stated Choice experiment, in which participants faced 16 hypothetical choice tasks. The screenshot below shows one of the choice tasks. Besides the choice tasks, participants were asked about their age and gender. The data collection has just finished. In total 125, participants have completed the experiment.<br>\n",
